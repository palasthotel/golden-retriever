# golden retriever

this drupal module implements a minimal shop.
In admin/config/golden_retriever one can configure which node types
are products and which field contains the price tag.
Additionally: this module provides a shopping cart block and a checkout form. And two new rule events to send mails.

Will be tested to work with varnish.
